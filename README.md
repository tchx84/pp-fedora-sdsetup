A collection of scripts that correctly sets up Fedora to run off your PinePhone SD card. Soon to be part of the Fedora Mobility SIG.

## **ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ WARNING! ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨** 
This is a **barely tested** collection of scripts written by someone who has never written a bash script for other people to use! It involves the **dd** command and **sudo**. This is **VERY DANGEROUS** - please do not run it unless you have read and fully understood what it will do. Better yet, read the scripts to learn how to install the image manually.

## Dependencies

- wget
- xz
- f2fs-tools (for mkfs.f2fs)
- dosfstools (for mkfs.vfat)
- rsync
- uboot-tools (for mkimage)
- qemu-user-static (for qemu-aarch64-static)

## Usage

1. Edit `.env` with your own variables.
2. Run `bash download-files.sh` then `sudo bash all.sh`. Verify the information presented whenever it asks you to confirm.

## Tips

- Run all scripts other than download-files.sh as root, and from this (README.md) directory! Do not directly run anything in the phone-scripts folder! Those scripts are, as the name suggests, executed on the phone.
- If a script fails midway through, some things may still be mounted. `sudo ./cleanup.sh` will attempt to unmount everything.
